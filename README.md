# Assembler

 Here my Assembler,works as an assembler which generate my LST file...

 LST file is that which which can be understanded by our machine.

 To generate that file we created and used some tables and codes named as :
 
 1.Symbol Table
 
 2.Literal Table
 
 3.Intermediate Code
 
 4.Opcode Table

 Here my code also generates new file of all Tables and Codes.

# To run and Generate LST file 
# type -> python one_pass.py

 After running this code, It generates...
 
 1.symbol_table.lst file
 
 2.literal_table.lst file
 
 3.intermediatelst file
 
 4.nihal.lst file

# ...Thank You...
